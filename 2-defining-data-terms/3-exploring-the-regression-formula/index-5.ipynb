    "In this lesson, we learned about a simple linear regression model.  A simple linear model has one input and one output.  The input is called the independent variable, $x$.  In our example above, customers is the dependent variable and temperature is the independent variable.  This makes sense as the number of customers predicted by our model *depends* on the temperature.  The temperature does not depend on anything in our model, so it's independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also discussed our coefficient, which is the number we multiply our independent variable by.  It is represented by $m$ in the fromula $y = mx $.  We can interpret our coefficient as the impact that our independent variable $x$ has on our dependent variable $y$.  So in the model $ tshirt\\_sales = .38*ad\\_spending$, this means our model predicts that a one dollar increase in spending increases the number of sales by .38.  The value of $m$ also determines the slope of our line -- the further $m$ is from zero, the steeper the slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we saw another component of our line, the intercept.  The intercept is the predicted output when our independent variable is zero.  So in our model of $ tshirt\\_sales = .38*ad\\_spending + 153.26 $ we say that even when the ad spending is zero, we expect sales of 153.  We also noticed that the intercept increases our predicted output by that value (here 153), for every input value.  So where we previously to predicted an output of 380 with spending of 1000 dollars, the updated formula predicts 380 + 153 = 533.  And where we previously to predicted sales of 418 with spending of 1100, the updated formula predicts 418 + 153 = 571.\n"
