But in the real world, this probably isn't true.  No matter how much we advertise, the company can still get a few purchases -- even if the CEO has to beg some friends and family.  So, let's say that in reality when there is no ad budget T-shirt sales will equal 100.  Here's how we can represent this.\n",
