    "Or to put it in terms of our graph above and formula $   distance=40âˆ—angle $, we want to change the our line such that it predicts outcomes that as close as possible to the actual observed distances.  Now in this lesson, we were introduced to **training data** a **hypothesis function** and a **loss function**.  In later lessons, we'll go through each of these steps in turn to better understand how machine learning algorithms work."
